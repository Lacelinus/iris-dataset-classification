# Iris Dataset Classification

In this code, we perform the classification of the Iris dataset using six different machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Classifier**
4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**
5. **Decision Tree Classifier**
6. **Random Forest Classifier**

## Overview

This code pre-processes the Iris dataset and applies these six classification algorithms to predict the species of Iris flowers. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we evaluate their performance using various metrics.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the Iris dataset (usually available as 'iris.csv') in your working directory.
2. Run the code, and it will load the dataset, preprocess it, and then apply the mentioned algorithms.
3. The code will print the confusion matrices for each algorithm, allowing you to evaluate their performance.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

Feel free to adjust the code to meet your specific requirements and preferences.
