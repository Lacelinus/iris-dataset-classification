# Iris Dataset Classification

In this code, we perform the classification of the Iris dataset using six different machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Classifier**
4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**
5. **Decision Tree Classifier**
6. **Random Forest Classifier**

## Overview

This code pre-processes the Iris dataset and applies these six classification algorithms to predict the species of Iris flowers. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we evaluate their performance using various metrics.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install pandas scikit-learn`.
4. Choose one of the provided classification scripts based on the machine learning algorithm you want to use:
   - `logistic_regression.py`
   - `knn_classifier.py`
   - `support_vector_classifier.py`
   - `gaussian_naive_bayes.py`
   - `decision_tree_classifier.py`
   - `random_forest_classifier.py`
5. Run the selected script.
6. The script will preprocess the Iris dataset and apply the chosen classification algorithm to predict the species of Iris flowers.
7. The results and evaluation metrics will be displayed, allowing you to assess the performance of the selected algorithm.
